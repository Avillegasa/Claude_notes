# Claude Code Course Workspace

## Overview
This workspace contains educational materials for a course on Claude Code, an AI-powered coding assistant. The primary content is in `Notes.md`, which explains how AI coding assistants operate through context gathering, planning, and tool-assisted actions.

## Architecture
- **Content Structure**: Single markdown file (`Notes.md`) with hierarchical headers explaining concepts
- **Purpose**: Educational documentation on AI coding assistant workflows
- **Data Flow**: Linear reading progression from basic concepts to detailed mechanics

## Key Patterns
- **Explanation Style**: Break down complex processes into major blocks and steps (e.g., "Gather context", "Formulate a plan", "Take action")
- **Markdown Structure**: Use H1/H2 headers for main sections, with nested subpoints for details
- **Terminology**: Reference specific components like "language model", "tool use", and "Claude Code"
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level overviews, then dive into specifics (as seen in the tool use explanation)

## Developer Workflows
- **Content Editing**: Directly edit `Notes.md` to add new sections or expand existing explanations
- **No Build Process**: Pure documentation - no compilation, testing, or deployment steps required
- **Version Control**: Standard git workflow for tracking changes to notes

## Conventions
- **Header Hierarchy**: Follow the pattern of main topic headers (#) with subtopic headers (##)
- **Incomplete Sections**: Mark unfinished content with trailing ellipses or notes (e.g., "### How does it works? [incomplete]")
- **Conceptual Flow**: Maintain logical progression from general concepts to specific implementations

## Integration Points
- **External References**: May link to Claude Code documentation or related AI assistant concepts
- **No Code Dependencies**: Pure markdown content with no external integrations

## Examples
- **Block Structure**: Mirror the "Typically models work the next way" section with major blocks and sub-steps
- **Question Format**: Use rhetorical questions or incomplete statements to guide reader thinking (e.g., "What's a coding assistant?")
- **Tool Emphasis**: Highlight tool use as a key differentiator, as in the "Tool Use Challenge" section

When contributing, maintain this educational tone and structural consistency. Focus on clarifying AI assistant mechanics through concrete examples and step-by-step breakdowns.
